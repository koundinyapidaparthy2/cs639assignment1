        "I'm Koundinya Pidaparthy, a dedicated software developer with a solid foundation in both
        frontend and backend technologies. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
        Lovely Professional University and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer
        Science at Pace University, where I maintain a GPA of 3.9.In my professional journey, I've

        Software Group. At Paysfer, I focused on creating seamless payment integrations using the
        MernStack, while at Hornblower Group, I played a pivotal role in developing a ticketing
        service platform used by renowned companies. Additionally, my tenure at Syscloud Software
        Group honed my frontend development skills, where I led the creation of reusable components
        and innovative npm packages.

        My technical expertise includes a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and
        tools, such as React, Node.js, GraphQL, Python, AWS, MongoDB, and Git. I'm passionate about
        leveraging technology to solve complex problems, as evidenced by my personal projects like
        Brain Bucket, Wordly, and Weather App.

        Overall, I bring a strong blend of academic knowledge and hands-on experience to any
        software development role, along with a drive for continuous learning and innovation."
